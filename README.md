<h1>CSS Techincal Documentation</h1><br>
<p>Made for FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Development Course</p><br><br>

<h4>Project Overview</h4>
<p> I needed to make a techincal document that was within the standards set by FreeCodeCamp. </p><br><br>

<h1>Problem</h1><br>
<p>Make something not boring, thats easy to read and digest for beginners</p><br>
<h1>Solutions<h1><br>
<p>This was made by me as I was first learning CSS, so its a lot of research reworded by me to make sense to someone who didnt know at the time</p><br>
<p> I went with something people would recogize when they think about programming with green and black for the background. Popular media shows programmers tapping away at command terminals and in dark mode all the time</p><br>
<p>I wanted the code snippets to have a hint of familiarity to learning and veteran programmers, so I imitated visual studio code to a degree but kept a bright color scheme to make it read-able and digestable.</p>
